# Elements and tags
- Every html document is made from elements, and elements are represented by tags
- Tags mark where different parts of an element start and/or stops
- All tags start with '<' and end with '>'
- Every element has an opening tag, e.g `<elementName>`
- 'elementName' may be followed by an attribute(or series of attributes that are separated by space)
- Set value for attribute using and = sign, some attributes are empty.
- The value of an empty attribute is either true or false based on the presence or absence of the attribute, regardless of its set value. e.g. `disable="false"` would also disable input control.
- Most elements have a closing tag, e.g `</elementName>`
- **Void elements**, which cannot contain contennt, do not have a closing tag
